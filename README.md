# My Data Science Portfolio

The following are some of the projects I've worked on (Summaries and business cases coming soon):

## [Jeopardy Analysis](https://github.com/Ifeadewumi/JeopardyAnalysis)


### Executive Summary
Jeopardy is a game that tests the ability of contestants to answer a wide variety of questions from all kinds of topics.

Preparing for a game of Jeopardy can take years and victory (or large prize money) is not a guarantee even then. This project is an attempt to help us use data science to prepare more effectively and give us a shot at Jeopardy glory.

This project uses regex to quickly clean, sort and search through the Jeopardy dataset, find commonalities and help calculate the significance of specific Jeopardy questions.
